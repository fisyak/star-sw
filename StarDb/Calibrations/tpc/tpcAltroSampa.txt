Hi Yuri, Guannan,

The thresholds are consistent by year, except the iTPC did change during commissioning in 2018 on day 160

Year          TPC                iTPC
Year    Thr_lo    Seq_lo    Thr_lo   Seq_lo
2015      3          2         -        -
2016      4          2         -        -
2017      4          2         -        -
(2018      4          2         4        2       Before day 160)
2018      4          2         4        1
2019      3          2         3        1
2020      3          2         3        1
2021      3          2         3        1
2022      3          2         4        1

The only way to figure out what was in the chips directly would be to look at adc files and look at the minimum 1-d cluster shapes.   This should be straightforward if truly needed, but I won't do it unless you believe there are inconsistencies...   and you point to specific time periods you want to check out...
