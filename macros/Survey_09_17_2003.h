  /* This is the survey data taken September 15 & 16,  2003. The Magnet is in the assembly building.
     Star Magnet is held in its design location, based on the 
     average least squares value of targets located on the face of the magnet.
     The TPC and SVT-SSD are located and related to the magnet.
     0,0,0  is the design center of the magnet, positive "X" is away from the  center of RHIC,
     positive  "Y" is west, and positive "Z" is above the beam height,  units are meters.
